# vim-config

To avoid having to re-setup vim on multiple machines, checking in my vim configuration.

You may find this useful. I currently use NerdTree and Super-Tab, and delimitmate plugins. I also have some custom settings in .vimrc file (whose contents you should appent in your own .vimrc file) like showing line numbers and Ctrl-C Ctrl-V mappings.
